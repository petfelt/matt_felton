Whilst memorizing Beethoven and Chopin he would often day dream and improvise at the piano based on the music in front of him. Although this made learning the music harder he found that he enjoyed the improvisation.</p>

    <p>Pianist and composer Matthew Felton’s impressionistic piano music crosses boundaries between genre’s from new age to improvisation to lyrical jazz. Deceptively simple with finesse and depth it can hold your attention and sooth your soul or just be great music to have on in the background at a dinner party. Felton has always be enthralled by minimalism in music and his own works are deceptively simple. His goal is to say what he is feeling with the fewest notes possible whilst deeply engaging the listener with the emotions and meaning of the piece. The challenge and danger of minimalism is that the music may become uninteresting or insipid. A few years ago he had the good fortune to meet and have a short lesson from George Winston.</p>
